# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! ðŸš€  
This project is a simple and elegant portfolio website designed using **HTML** and **CSS**.  

## Features

- **About Me**: A brief introduction about myself.  
- **Projects**: A showcase of my recent work and achievements.  
- **Skills**: A section highlighting my key skills.  
- **Contact Me**: A form or section with ways to get in touch.  

## Why This Project?

This is my first portfolio project built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**. It helped me understand:  
- Writing clean and semantic HTML.  
- Styling with CSS, including layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.  
- Responsive design principles to make the website mobile-friendly.
